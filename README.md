# sawtooth-contrib

The sawtooth-contrib repository contains contributed software for
[Sawtooth](https://sawtooth.splinter.dev/), a platform for
building distributed ledgers.

This repository is intended for community-contributed software, including
example libraries, applications, and reference implementations for  transaction
families (Sawtooth's version of smart contracts). This software is designed to
work with the Sawtooth platform software in the [sawtooth-core
repository](https://github.com/splintercommunity/sawtooth-core).


## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions to this repository, either as changes to existing
software or as new example tools and reference implementations. Please follow
